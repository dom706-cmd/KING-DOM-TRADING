RESULT:
You'll have a scanner that looks and functions like a $50k/year Bloomberg terminal but costs $0 to run. It won't beat Citadel's $1B infrastructure, but for retail trading and showing in class? It'll blow minds.

Bottom line: This gives you 90% of what professionals use for sentiment, technicals, and risk management. Missing the ultra-fast execution and exotic data, but for analysis and presentation? Gold standard.
